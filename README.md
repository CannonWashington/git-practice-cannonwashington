I have lost 100 pounds over the last year. 


I've learned how to revert commits, how annoying the Github Website experience can be, and that README.md is not just a txt file. 

In my collaboration I learned what Pull Requests look like from the owners side. My group and I didn't quite know what to recommend or change in our Github though since it was mainly answering some basic questions about ourselves.
