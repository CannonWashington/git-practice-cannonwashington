I made README.md.txt first, as opposed to just a README.md, because I both made it on Github Desktop and because I didn't think about the difference between a .md and .txt. I added a real README.md, and left in the other as an artifact and because I used it for the Conflict Resolution Merge. 

Speaking of the conflict merge, I combined what was type in both versions of the file and made sure to highlight where each came from.
